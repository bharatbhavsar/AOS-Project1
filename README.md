Design and implement Algorithm for Distributed Spanning tree

Build a distributed system consisting of n nodes arranged in a certain topology. The value of n, the location of each node and its set of neighbors is specified in a configuration file. You can assume that the communication topology specified in the configuration file corresponds to an undirected (symmetric) graph. That is, if node u is a neighbor of node v, then v is also a neighbor of u. Further, the communication topology generates a connected graph. Develop and implement a distributed algorithm that builds a spanning tree of the system rooted at a given node (specified in the configuration file). Note that, when the spanning tree construction algorithm terminates, each node should know its parent and its children in the tree.

The code is yet to be uploaded. Will upload code after the project submission to avoid any plagiarism involving my code.

Thanks!
